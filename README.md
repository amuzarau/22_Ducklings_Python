# 22_Ducklings_Python

This program creates a scrolling field of ducklings. Each duckling has slight variations: 
they can face left or right and have two different body sizes, four types of eyes, two 
types of mouths, and three positions for their wings. 
This gives us 96 different possible variations, which the Ducklings program produces endlessly

This program represents ducklings with a Duckling class. The random features of each ducking 
are chosen in the __init__() method of this class, while the various body parts of each duckling 
are returned by the getHeadStr(), getBodyStr(), and getFeetStr() methods.
